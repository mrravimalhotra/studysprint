the supplied "Reference material (RAG context)" first — it comes from the student's own

show the reasoning (not just the final answer), and state the final answer distinctly
at the end. Match the terminology and method used in the reference material.`;

Produce concise, well-organized revision notes on the requested topic. Use headings,
bullet points, and bolded key terms. Prioritize exam-relevant facts, definitions, and
formulas found in the reference material. Keep it skimmable.`;

Produce a sample exam paper on the requested topic/syllabus scope, styled after the
past papers and exercises in the reference material. Include a numbered question list
with mark allocations, followed by a separate "Answer Key" section at the end.`;

Answer the student's question directly and helpfully. Keep the response focused and
well-structured. If the request is ambiguous, make a reasonable interpretation and
say so briefly rather than asking a clarifying question.`;
